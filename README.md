# CS101 Algorithm Implementations

This can be disregarded because it will only contain some basic algorithms written in Go. This makes it easy to share them between computers and read on-the-go when I need to.

## Algorithms Contained
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort

... More to come as the class progressess and I feel the need to have the algorithm written. 

#### Academic Integrity
These algorithms are not part of class testing and are completely easy to find online. This does not violate any academic integrity rules as a result.
